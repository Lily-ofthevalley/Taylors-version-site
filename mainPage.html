                Taylor Swift began her carreer at a indie music label called Big Machine Records. This was owned by scooter brown.
                When she was 15 years old she signed a 13 year contract in which she didnt own any of the music she wrote while working under
                Big Machine Records. When Taylors contract ended with Big Machine Records Scooter Braun sold taylors music without
                her knowledge to Shamrock Holdings even tho Taylor wanted to buy them herself so she could own her own music.
                When she signed a new contract Republic Records she decided to rerecord her old albums as Taylor's versions so she could own them
                herself.

                Since Taylor started to release her Taylor's versions of her old albums she continued to put easter eggs everywhere to hint
                when her next album would come out and what it was about. This site is for those easter eggs. We have a page for every current
                and upcoming taylor's version with alot of the easter eggs. There is also a form at the bottom of each page where you can send
                in all the eatser eggs we may have missed or the easter eggs we didn't know about.
